 # shiny Project files are:
  1.	ui.R – the R file controlling the user interface
  2.	server.R – the R file controlling the server side of the application.
  3.	dataPrep.R – the file that take the original file from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database and process it for use by the application. 
  4.	mstrGrps.R – The R file that assigns Master groups to the original Weather Events, the original Weather Events were too numerous for effective reporting.
  5.	usa_wea_dmg.csv – The file that is created by the  dataPrep.R and mstrGrps.R files and is used by both the application and presentation. 
  6.	last_state.csv – a summary state file used to start the application
  7.	www – A folder that holds the graphics used by the application. 

 # Presentation Project files are: 
  1.	project_presso.Rpres –  the R file controlling the presentation 
  2.	project_presso.md – the presentation markdown file.
  3.	project_presso.html – a html version of the presentation without the R code visible for better presentation. 
  4.	project_presso-rpubs.html – a html version of the presentation with the R code visible to allow repeatability of the reaserch.
